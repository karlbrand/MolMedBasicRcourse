## 1.1 Use R to do the following exercises on the BOD data. ##
######                                                  ######

## 1.1.1 Display the built-in dataset called BOD by running BOD.

## 1.1.2 What is the data structure of BOD? What are the dimensions?
 
## 1.1.3 What are the names of BOD? Use a function other than str.
 
## 1.1.4 Make a line graph of demand versus time, where the line is a pink dot-dashed line. Add a blue dashed line of 1.1 times the demand and give it a thickness of 2. Make sure both lines are entirely visible by adjusting the range of y.

## 1.2 Use R to do the following exercises on the chickwts data. ##
######                                                       ######

## 1.2.1 Display the built-in chickwts data.
 
## 1.2.2 What is the data structure of chickwts? What are the dimensions? 
 
## 1.2.3 What are the names of chickwts? Use a function other than str.
 
## 1.2.4 What are the levels of feed?
 
## 1.2.5 Make the following plots in one 2 x 2 image:
   
    #  A bar chart of the feed types, each bar a different color.  
    #  A bar chart of the proportions of feed types, each bar a different color.  
    #  A boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box a different color.  
    #  A horizontal boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box a different color.

## 1.3 Use R to do the following exercises on the Puromycin data. ##
######                                                        ######

## 1.3.1 Display the built-in Puromycin data.

## 1.3.2 Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the concentration. Describe the relationship.
 
## 1.3.3 Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration. Describe the relationship.
 
## 1.3.4 Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration and color the points by treatment group (state). Describe what you see.
 
## 1.3.5 Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration, color the points by treatment group (state), label the x-axis "Concentration" and the y-axis "Rate", and label the plot "Puromycin".
 
## 1.3.6 Add a legend to the above plot indicating what the points represent. 
 
## 1.3.7 Make a boxplot of the treated versus untreated rates. Using the function pdf, save the image to a file with a width and height of 7 inches.
 
## 1.3.8 Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations. What is the width of the bins?
 
## 1.3.9 Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations with a bin width of 0.10. How is this different from the histogram above? 
 
## 1.3.10 Plot the histograms side by side in the same graphic window and make sure they have the same range on the y-axis. Does this make it easier to answer the question of how the two histograms differ?
