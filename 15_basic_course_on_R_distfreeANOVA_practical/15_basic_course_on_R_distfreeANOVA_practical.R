## Basic Course on R:
## Distribution-free ANOVA
## (Practical)

## 1. Read in the data ``dogs.csv'' with a header. 
##    Assign it to the object "doggies" and allow strings be converted to factors. 
##    Attach the data to the environment.

## 2. Answer the following questions using the dog data:

  ## 2(a) We're going to use Friedman's test. Which factor represents the blocks and why?

  ## 2(b) Make a boxplot of the concentration grouped by anesthetic. 
  ##      Which anesthetic do you think might be different from the others?  

  ## 2(c) Perform the appropriate Friedman's test in R.

  ## 2(d) What do you conclude about the effect of anesthetics on 
  ##      plasma epinephrine concentration (use a significance level of 0.05)?

## 3. Read in the data "moms.csv" with a header. 
##    Assign it to the object "mommies" and allow strings to be converted to factors. 
##    Attach the data to the environment. 

## 4. Answer the following questions using the mom data:

  ## 4(a) Test at significance level 0.05 for equality of the three population means (use the Kruskal-Wallis test).

  ## 4(b) Make a boxplot of the cortisol level grouped by C-section groups. 
  ##      Use it to explain why we didn't use an F test (regular one-way ANOVA).
